## GGML scripts

This repo is a collection of small Python scripts.

Scripts tend to be compact, and ideally should perform one well-documented function, and run with any modern python3 interpreter with zero dependencies.

We might break these rules at some point when it's convenient but not right now.

### Scripts

- [`ggml_check.py`](./ggml_check.py): This script accepts on the command line a list of arguments as file paths. For each file it prints out the relevant GGML format and version
